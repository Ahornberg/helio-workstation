## Version 3.3
 - Added initial support for custom temperaments, the default list includes 22-EDO and 31-EDO; added commands to switch temperament or convert a piece into any other temperament
 - Added keyboard mapping page for instruments, allowing to overcome the limits of MIDI 1.0 for microtonal music, or just to re-map any key for whatever purposes
 - Removed the built-in piano samples to reduce binary size, and added a simple sine-like synth which works in any n-tone equal temperament out of the box; it sucks, but hopefully it will be improved in future
 - Added a command to switch to the most visible track/clip in the viewport, hotkey F3
 - Fixed note previewing for some instruments: now it sends note-off events after a delay
 - Minor UI tweaks: made animations a but shorter and sharper, fixed several focus issues when deleting tracks, the resizable edge in note components now depends on the note width
