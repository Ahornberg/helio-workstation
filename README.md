## ![Screenshot](Docs/images/screen-v3.png)
[Helio Workstation](https://helio.fm) is free and open-source music sequencer, designed to be used on all major platforms.


## Why another sequencer?

Most of the DAW interfaces often seem [overcomplicated](http://mashable.com/2015/09/18/german-u-boat/), and they only tend to get more and more bloated over time. Many of them are commercial, proprietary-licensed and almost none of them support all major operating systems at the same time.

Helio is an attempt to rethink a music sequencer to create a tool that **feels right**.

It aims to be a modern music creation software, featuring linear-based/pattern-based sequencer with clean UI, integrated version control for synchronizing project between devices, translations to many languages, small portable builds and more; mainly targeted at hobbyist composers, game developers and indie artists.

## Contributing

Helio is still a work in progress, and there are several ways you could help:

* [Proofread and improve the translation](https://helio.fm/translations) for your native language.

* Maintain a package for your favourite Linux distro - highly appreciated, please see the list of available and missing packages [here](https://repology.org/project/helio-workstation/versions).

* Your thoughts on any usability improvements are welcome: friendly and lightweight UI is the main development priority in this project, so feel free to help me identify the main friction points.

* Implement new features: some guys were asking me if I have any tasks for them to start working on, but, as a sole unpaid developer with limited amount of time and interest, I'm not planning stories or organising the board, instead I only work on the parts that are fun and important for me at the moment. If you don't know where to start, my suggestion is that you do the same: find a missing feature or behavior you're lacking the most, and make the app a little more convinient for yourself. Anyway, feel free to ask questions and create incomplete PR's to get intermediate feedback.
